# Dashboard Development Issues & Takeaways

## Project Goal
Create an interactive disaster law dashboard similar to the minimum wage reference dashboard with:
- Interactive choropleth map showing state-level data with click functionality
- State detail panel showing comprehensive law information
- Filter controls for different law categories
- Dark theme with professional styling

## Critical Issues Encountered

### üî¥ **Map Interaction Problems**
1. **Non-clickable Map**: Despite implementing `on_select="rerun"` and click handlers, the Plotly choropleth map was not clickable in the browser
2. **No Color Display**: The map showed state outlines but no color fill, indicating data mapping issues between state names and Plotly's location expectations
3. **Session State Issues**: Map click events were not properly captured or stored in session state

### üî¥ **Data Processing Issues**
1. **State Name Mismatches**: 
   - Excel data contains entries like "Iowa, etc." and "Guam, USVI, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands"
   - Multi-state entries need proper expansion and normalization
   - Territory names may not match Plotly's expected location codes

2. **Empty Protection Scores**: 
   - Many states showed protection scores of 0 or very low values
   - Scoring algorithm may not be properly weighing available data
   - Data columns may contain mostly NaN or empty values

3. **Column Mapping Problems**:
   - Different Excel files have varying column structures
   - Column normalization may be losing data during processing
   - Need better handling of inconsistent schemas

### üî¥ **Technical Implementation Issues**
1. **Plotly Configuration**: 
   - Colorbar properties used deprecated syntax (`titlefont` vs `title.font`)
   - Map styling may not be compatible with current Plotly version
   
2. **Streamlit Limitations**:
   - Map click events are unreliable in Streamlit
   - Session state management for map interactions is complex
   - Plotly chart interactions have known limitations in Streamlit

3. **State Selector Issues**:
   - Dropdown functionality works but doesn't trigger proper re-renders
   - State detail updates are not consistent
   - Need better integration between map and dropdown selection

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issue: Data-Map Integration**
The core problem appears to be that our processed state data doesn't properly align with Plotly's choropleth expectations:

1. **Location Mapping**: Plotly choropleth requires exact state name matches (e.g., "California", not "CA" or "California, Oregon")
2. **Data Aggregation**: Multiple rows per state aren't being properly aggregated for visualization
3. **Score Calculation**: Protection scores may be calculated incorrectly due to missing or malformed data

### **Secondary Issue: Streamlit-Plotly Integration**
Streamlit's handling of Plotly interactions is limited:
1. Click events don't reliably trigger reruns
2. Map state selection requires complex session state management  
3. Alternative approaches (like using st.plotly_chart with selection) have compatibility issues

## Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ **What Worked**
1. **Data Loading**: Successfully loaded and parsed 25+ Excel files with varying schemas
2. **UI Styling**: CSS styling and dark theme implementation worked well
3. **Layout Design**: Two-column layout with metrics and filters was effective
4. **State Selection Dropdown**: Basic dropdown functionality worked for state selection

### ‚ùå **What Didn't Work**
1. **Map Interactivity**: Could not achieve reliable map click functionality
2. **Color Visualization**: States did not display proper color coding
3. **Data Integration**: Failed to properly connect processed data to map visualization
4. **Real-time Updates**: Map and detail panel synchronization was inconsistent

## Recommendations for Next Attempt

### üéØ **Core Strategy Changes**
1. **Start with Streamlit Documentation**: Read official docs for plotly_chart, session_state, and map interactions
2. **Simpler Data Structure**: Begin with a single Excel file to establish working baseline
3. **Alternative Visualization**: Consider using st.map() or other Streamlit-native components instead of Plotly
4. **Incremental Development**: Build basic functionality first, then add complexity

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**
1. **Data Validation First**: 
   - Ensure state names exactly match Plotly requirements
   - Validate protection scores are calculated correctly
   - Test with minimal dataset before scaling

2. **Map Implementation Options**:
   - **Option A**: Use Folium with st.folium for better interactivity
   - **Option B**: Use st.plotly_chart with simpler scatter plots on map
   - **Option C**: Use st.map with custom markers and popups

3. **Interaction Strategy**:
   - Rely primarily on dropdown selection rather than map clicks
   - Use map hover information to guide user selection
   - Implement clear visual feedback for selected states

### üìã **Development Checklist for Next Session**
1. ‚úÖ Read Streamlit documentation on maps and plotly integration
2. ‚úÖ Create minimal working example with 3-5 states and simple data
3. ‚úÖ Verify color mapping works before adding complexity
4. ‚úÖ Test click interactions with simple callback functions
5. ‚úÖ Gradually add data complexity only after basic functionality works
6. ‚úÖ Consider alternative visualization libraries if Plotly continues to have issues

## Data Quality Issues to Address

### üîç **State Data Normalization**
- **Multi-state entries**: "Iowa, etc." needs to be properly expanded
- **Territory handling**: Territories need separate handling from states
- **Consistency**: Ensure all state names use full names (not abbreviations)

### üìä **Protection Score Algorithm**
- **Weight validation**: Verify scoring weights make sense for the data
- **Data completeness**: Handle cases where most fields are empty
- **Score distribution**: Ensure scores have meaningful variation across states

### üìÅ **File Processing**  
- **Schema mapping**: Create robust column mapping that handles all file variations
- **Error handling**: Better handling of corrupted or incomplete files
- **Data validation**: Validate data integrity during processing

## Tools and Libraries Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Successful Components**
- **Streamlit**: Core app framework worked well
- **Pandas**: Data processing was effective
- **CSS Styling**: Custom styling achieved desired appearance

### ‚ùå **Problematic Components**  
- **Plotly Choropleth**: Interaction issues, data mapping problems
- **Session State**: Complex state management for map interactions
- **PyDeck**: Previous attempts also had interaction issues

### ü§î **Alternative Approaches to Consider**
- **Folium**: Better interactivity for maps
- **Altair**: Streamlit-native visualization
- **Simple HTML/JS**: Custom map implementation
- **Multiple visualization types**: Combine map with other chart types

---

**Bottom Line**: The interactive map functionality requires a more thorough understanding of Streamlit's capabilities and limitations. The next attempt should focus on documentation-first approach and incremental development rather than complex feature implementation from the start.
